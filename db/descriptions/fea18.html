	Feature 18, a circular pit, was located just outside Structure 9 at 236.5R70.
It measured 3.3 ft in diameter and was 0.9 ft deep.  The walls curved inward to
a flat bottom.  The fill at the base of the plowzone was noticeably different
from that of neighboring features (i.e., <a href="../excavations/exc_al.html" target="_top"><u>Feature
17</u></a>,
<a href="../excavations/exc_an.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 19</u></a>,  and <a href="../excavations/exc_ap.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 20</u></a>).  The latter were defined by a homogeneous, dark brownish
black loam at the top of the subsoil, whereas Feature 18 was defined by a
heterogeneous brown loam (Zone 1) with flecks of orange clay, charcoal, and
bits of ash.  At the bottom of Zone 1 was a layer of large potsherds,
representing three vessels (<a href="../excavations/slid_bal.html" target="body"><u>first</u></a>, <a href="../excavations/slid_bam.html" target="body"><u>second</u></a>).  These lay on top of a thin lens of dark charcoal.
Interspersed among the potsherds were numerous fragments of a large grinding or
polishing stone.  Postholes were noted at the bottom of the pit along with a
small depression (0.3 ft in diameter) filled with charcoal.<p>
