	Feature 30 was an almost circular feature that measured 2.9 ft by 2.8 ft in
plan view and was 2.2 ft deep.  It was located just east of Structure 10 at
271.3R21.5.  At subsoil, the pit appeared as a circular patch of dark brown
loam (designated Zone 1) with potsherds, rocks, and animal bone.  This fill
zone also contained pockets of ash and yellow sandy clay, and it was
approximately 1.5 ft deep.  Zone 1 rested upon Zone 2, which was similar except
that it had a more reddish hue.  Zone 2 also contained less cultural material
than Zone 1 and was approximately 0.7 ft thick.  The pit sides were straight
and the bottom was flat.<p>
