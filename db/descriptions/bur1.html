<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Burial 1 was located at the southeast end of the cemetery at 276.8R90.3.  The
pit for Burial 1 was first observed as a rectangular patch of dark brown humus
containing a generous amount of charcoal, animal bones, and other refuse.  It
was oriented northwest-southeast, had a maximum length of 3.6 ft and a maximum
width of 2.6 ft, and was rectangular in plan.  When excavated, the pit was
found to have straight walls and a flat bottom, and it was 2.4 ft deep.  The
relatively flat walls and bottom showed evidence of having been dug with bladed
(probably metal) digging implements.  The fill was comprised of three distinct
soil zones. Zone 1 consisted of a dark brown humus rich in refuse, including
charred food debris (animal bones and charred plant parts), potsherds, part of
a corroded iron knife blade, and numerous glass beads.  The northern half of
Zone 1 was noticeably richer than the southern half.  Zone 1 rested upon an
irregular layer of mottled orange clay with ashy lens (Zone 2) that appeared to
intrude Zone 1 in the northern section of the pit.  It also contained lenses of
grayish black fill which were excavated separately from the mottled orange
clay.  Zone 2 probably represents a transitional face between Zone 1 and the
bottom zone, Zone 3.  The latter consisted solely of mottled orange clay
(probably a portion of the soil excavated to create the pit) typical of burial
fill at other Piedmont village sites.  The homogeneity of Zone 1 could have
resulted only from the intentional filling of the upper portion of the burial
pit with refuse-rich soil.<p>

<i>Burial Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	The burial was that of a child of indeterminate sex who died at 3.5 +/- 1
years of age.  The child's body was placed into the pit in a loosely flexed
position and was lying on its left side. The skull was positioned to the
southeast.  The right arm lay across the chest, whereas the left arm lay
straight along the left side.<p>

<i>Grave Goods</i><p>

	Around the wrist, waist, and shoulders were numerous shell beads that probably
had been sewn to a blanket or garment.  A bundle containing a <a href="../excavations/slid_ajj.html" target="body"><u>latten
spoon</u></a> with a round
pecked stone in the bowl, two bone-handled iron knives (see
<a href="../excavations/slid_ajp.html" target="body"><u>first</u></a>,
<a href="../excavations/slid_ami.html" target="body"><u>second</u></a>), two
pairs of scissors (see <a href="../excavations/slid_ajo.html" target="body"><u>first</u></a>, <a href="../excavations/slid_amd.html" target="body"><u>second</u></a>), seven lead <a href="../excavations/slid_ajk.html" target="body"><u>buttons</u></a> (also see
<a href="../excavations/slid_bbw.html" target="body"><u>close-up</u></a>), and
numerous glass beads were located between the face and the southwest corner of
the pit.  Over the sternum were a <a href="../excavations/slid_aho.html" target="body"><u>large shell
gorget</u></a> and a
<a href="../excavations/slid_ahp.html" target="body"><u>small shell gorget</u></a> with punctated designs.<p>
