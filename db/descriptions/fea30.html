	This circular feature lay approximately 5 ft north of <a href="../excavations/exc_ax.html" target="_top"><u>Feature
28</u></a> and 7 ft
northeast of <a href="../excavations/exc_iz.html" target="_top"><u>Structure 4</u></a>.  It was also located northwest of the cemetery burials
and just outside the village palisade.  It was centered at 324.7R40.7 and
measured 3.0 ft by 2.8 ft in plan view and 3.4 ft in depth.  The center portion
of the pit was defined at the base of plowzone by a circular zone (Zone 1) of
very dark grayish brown clay loam with animal bones and charcoal.  Surrounding
Zone 1 was a band of mottled orange brown clay, designated Zone 2.  When this
zone was excavated it created a shallow shelf surrounding the perimeter of the
pit.  Zone 2 probably represents a transitional soil band that extended beyond
the original pit wall.  Animal bone was concentrated in the center of Zone 1
and increased at the interface between Zone 1 and Zone 3, which was separated
from Zone 1 by an ashy lens.  Zone 1 averaged 1.3 ft in thickness.  Zone 3
consisted of a reddish brown, ashy loam with animal bone and charcoal which
averaged 0.8 ft in thickness.  Zone 3 lay atop Zone 4, a relatively thin (0.3
ft) band of yellowish red-brown mottled clay loam containing charcoal and
animal bones.  Zone 4, in turn, rested on Zone 5, a band (0.6 ft thick) of soil
similarly colored to Zone 4 except that it contained light ash at the northern
edge of the pit.  The final zone, Zone 6, was defined by a yellowish red
mottled clay with brown loam.  It was 0.4 ft thick.  The final four zones were
very similar in fill characteristics and probably could be considered together
as a single depositional episode.  The pit walls bowed out in the center,
creating a barrel-shaped profile.  The pit floor was flat. In general, the
amount of animal bone increased with the depth of the pit.  Bear and deer bones
were noted, and an unusual number of deer scapulae appeared to be
represented.<p>
