<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>

	This grave was located south of Structure 12 at 212.9R11.3.  As with other
non-cemetery burials at the site, the deceased was buried in a
shaft-and-chamber pit.  After excavation, the pit measured 3.5 ft long, 2.5 ft
wide, and 1.3 ft deep.<p>

<i>Body Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	In this burial, the loosely flexed remains of a 12-year-old subadult were
placed in the side chamber of a shaft-and-chamber pit with the head oriented to
the east.<p>

<i>Grave Goods</i><p>
<p>
	Shell beads were strung around the neck and the right wrist.  European trade
artifacts consisted of a brass buckle and several pewter buttons in the waist
area, brass rings on the fingers of both hands, and numerous white glass beads
in the area of the right hip.  At the landowner's request, all bones and
associated grave goods were left in place and carefully covered with sand and
clean soil.<p>
