	This designation was assigned to a 35-ft segment of a long, irregular trench
that ran in a north-south direction and intruded <a href="../excavations/exc_it.html" target="_top"><u>Structure
10</u></a> and
<a href="../excavations/exc_iu.html" target="_top"><u>Structure 11</u></a>.  It averaged approximately 2.5 ft wide, 0.3 ft deep, and
contained small amounts of pottery, rock, and European-made artifacts
(primarily glass beads).  Thin traces of this feature were observed at the
north end of the excavation in 1985 but were not excavated.  This earlier
evidence, coupled with the 35-ft section excavated in 1986, indicate that the
trench was at least 75 ft long.  Although this feature certainly post-dates
both structures, it cannot be firmly associated with later Euroamerican
activity in the site vicinity.  This conclusion is based on the fact that no
Euroamerican artifacts were found in the trench that post-date the Occaneechi
occupation of the site.  The exact nature and function of this feature is
unknown.<p>
