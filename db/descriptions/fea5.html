<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Feature 5 (Burial 7) was located near the center of the cemetery at
290.0R80.4.  This burial pit was visible as a nearly oval stain of mottled
brown and orange clay at the base of the plowzone.  The pit was oriented with
its long axis northwest-southeast and measured 3.4 ft long, 2.3 ft wide, and
1.2 ft deep.  The upper fill of this pit, designated Zone 1, was unique in that
it was quite homogenous and did not contain the rich layer of refuse found in
the other burial pits within the cemetery.  It was approximately 0.6 ft thick.
A small pocket of brown humus in the southwest corner was the only distinct
difference and probably represents a small mass of original humus that was
incorporated in the final stage of refilling.  Zone 2 was very similar to Zone
1 and also contained mottled clay that was roughly 0.6 ft thick.  After the
floor of the pit was located and troweled, a band of light brown soil was
evident along the northeast wall.  This layer was excavated, creating a narrow
side chamber that dipped slightly below the level of the rest of the pit and
undercut the northeast wall.  The remaining walls sloped inward slightly at the
bottom.<p>

<i>Body Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	Burial 7 contained the poorly preserved remains of a neonate who was less than
three months old at death.  The individual appeared to be oriented with the
head toward the southeast.<p>

<i>Grave Goods</i><p>

	Two <a href="../excavations/slid_bdd.html" target="body"><u>clusters</u></a> of
cast brass bells lay in the northwest half of the pit.  Given the orientation
of the other burials, they were associated with the legs of the individual.
There were 10-15 incised <a href="../excavations/slid_akn.html" target="body"><u>bells</u></a> in each cluster held together by leather thongs, portions of
which were preserved, as well as fragments of <a href="../excavations/slid_alm.html" target="body"><u>wood or
matting</u></a> that had
been on the floor of the pit.<p>
