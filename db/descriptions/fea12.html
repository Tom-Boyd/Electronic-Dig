	Feature 12 was located between <a href="../excavations/exc_iy.html" target="_top"><u>Structure 3</u></a> and the eastern palisade entrance into
the village (at 264.0R85.5).  It was 3.4 ft long, 3.2 ft wide, and 1.4 ft
deeper than the top of subsoil.  The depth-to-diameter ratio was 0.51,
suggesting that it could have functioned as a storage facility.  The location
of this pit is somewhat enigmatic because of its proximity to the palisade
entrance, in what was probably an area of heavy traffic.  It is possible that
this feature represents a small soil recovery facility rather than a storage
pit. <p>

	Feature 12 contained two zones of fill.  The upper zone, Zone 1, was a dark
reddish-brown sandy loam containing a variety of European trade items,
aboriginal potsherds, charcoal, fired clay, charred plant food remains, and a
large quantity of animal bone.  The animal remains consisted of box turtle,
deer, and bear.  The plant food remains were mostly hickory nutshell, with a
small amount of acorn shell, peach pit, and corn.  Among the trade items were
glass beads, copper wire, and the handle and blade of an iron knife.  This zone
was relatively thin and confined to the central area of the feature.  The
composition and texture of this fill suggest that it originated as household
debris representing a variety of activities. <p>

	Zone 2 was a homogeneous deposit of dark brown sandy loam mottled with
subsoil.  Numerous animal bone fragments, charred plant remains, wood charcoal,
European trade items, lithic artifacts, potsherds, and plant remains were
recovered in this zone.  The animal bone consisted of deer, box turtle, turkey,
squirrel, and bear.  The plant food remains were mostly hickory nutshell with a
small amount of corn and cucurbit.  The homogeneous brown color of the fill,
the small amount of wood charcoal, and the diversity of animal and plant
species suggest that this fill was redeposited midden and humus.<p>
