	Feature 51 was located inside Structure 12 at 224.2R5.2.  This storage pit was
observed at the base of plowzone as an almost circular stain of brown, ashy
clay loam (Zone 2) that encircled an area of burned clay with a charcoal
concentration (Zone 1).  Excavation revealed the latter to be a thin lens only
about a 0.2 ft in thickness.  The Zone 2 soil maintained its consistency until
near the pit bottom where increased amounts of yellow clay were encountered.
The fill was rich in animal bones and contained numerous artifacts, including
potsherds, glass beads, clay pipe fragments, gunflints, a bone knife handle, a
few stone tools, and fire-cracked rock.<p>

	The pit bottom was slightly concave and the sides sloped inward at the bottom.
It measured 2.4 ft in diameter and was 2.0 ft deep.  This feature was rapidly
filled soon after it ceased to be used for storage.  The ashy content of the
fill, as well as the upper lens of burned orange clay, may indicate that this
soil and refuse was collected as part of cleaning activities around an area of
food preparation and consumption.<p>
