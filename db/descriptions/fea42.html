	Feature 42 was located near the southeastern edge of the palisaded village at
198.0R73.0.  A circular stain of dark gray soil mottled with charcoal and
burned clay flecks (designated Zone 1) defined this pit at the base of the
plowzone.  Also noted at the pit surface were numerous animal bones and rock
fragments.  Two gunflints and several glass beads were also recovered from Zone
1, which had a maximum thickness of about 0.5 ft.<p>

	At the base of Zone 1, a gray ashy soil (designated Zone 2) was encountered.
This zone was noticeably moist and got progressively wetter toward the bottom.
It contained numerous animal bones, several aboriginal and kaolin-clay pipe
fragments, and one complete "onion-form" clay pipe.  Several rocks were also
encountered.  Zone 2 extended to an average depth of 1.6 ft below the subsoil
surface and rested on a thin band of mottled clay and gray soil, designated
Zone 3, that contained almost no artifacts.  This zone extended to the bottom
of the pit, which was reached at a depth of 1.8 ft.<p>

	In plan, the feature was circular, measuring approximately 3.0 ft in diameter.
The sides bowed out slightly toward the bottom, creating a bell-shaped profile.
Apparently, the feature was originally excavated for storage purposes.  Given
the composition of Zone 3, it appears that after the pit was emptied of its
contents, an indeterminate amount of time passed before it was filled with
debris.  The upper fill zones strongly suggest that hearth areas or other food
preparation facilities were cleaned and the resulting refuse used to finish
filling the pit.  The clay mottling in Zone 1 probably resulted from subsoil
slumping into the pit as the fill settled.<p>
