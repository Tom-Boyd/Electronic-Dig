	Feature 56 was located between Structure 11 and the village palisade at
252.5L9.0, and it probably is associated with that structure.  At the top of
the subsoil, the fill (Zone 1) from this pit was almost identical to that
comprising Zone 1 of <a href="../excavations/exc_bz.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 53</u></a>.  It consisted of a brown loam mottled
with small particles of orange clay and contained numerous animal bones and
fragments of charcoal.  Also included within the zone were a large number of
potsherds, two bone knife handles, a gun part, and both glass and shell beads.
The upper part of Zone 1 also contained a 0.3-ft thick lens of gray ash.  This
ashy layer was virtually sterile except for a few potsherds and a couple of
fragments of burned bone.<p>
<p>
	Zone 1 was underlain by a brown loam mottled with tan ashy soil and small
particles of burned red clay (Zone 2).  The artifacts and subsistence remains
found in Zone 2 were comparable to those from Zone 1.<p>
<p>
	The zone of fill, Zone 3, consisted of a mottled orange clay and also was very
similar to the lower zone in <a href="../excavations/exc_bz.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 53</u></a>.  It measured 1.8 ft in thickness and
comprised over half the total volume of the pit.  The cultural material
recovered from this zone, however, was very sparse.<p>
<p>
	The sides of the feature were generally straight, although they did slope
inward slightly toward the bottom, which was flat. In plan, the pit was
circular with a diameter of 2.8 ft, and was the deepest feature excavated on
the site, extending 3.3 ft below the base of the plowzone.<p>
<p>
	The pit morphology and fill characteristics suggest the following activity
sequence: (1) the feature was initially used to store and probably conceal an
unknown variety of goods and resources; (2) after being abandoned for storage,
a large volume of clay soil mixed with humus from an unknown source, perhaps a
nearby, freshly dug pit, was dumped into the empty hole; (3) food refuse mixed
with household debris and ash was deposited atop the mottled clay; and (4) a
larger amount of domestic refuse and fill derived from food preparation and
consumption activities was used to completely fill the pit.<p>
