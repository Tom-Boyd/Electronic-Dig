<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	This burial was placed in a shaft-and-chamber pit and was located in the
southern part of the site at 183.4R36.5, just outside the palisade in what
appears to be a southern entrance into the village.  The pit was 2.4 ft long,
2.0 ft wide, and 1.1 ft deep.<p>
<p>
<i>Body Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	This burial contained the remains of an infant who was about six months old at
time of death.  Bone preservation was extremely poor, but it appears that the
legs were flexed and the head pointed to the south-southwest.<p>
<p>
<i>Grave Goods</i><p>
<p>
	Brass bells, which preserved small fragments of cane matting, were found in
the leg area.  The presence of matting suggests that the body was wrapped prior
to interment.  A lead bale seal and several shell beads also were present in
the leg area.  At the landowner's request, all bones and associated grave goods
were left in place and carefully covered with sand and clean soil.<p>
