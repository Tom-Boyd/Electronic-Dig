	Feature 61 was located near Structure 12 at 223.8L3.8.  At the surface of the
subsoil, this feature appeared to be a large burial pit, roughly circular in
outline but oriented along a slight northwest-southeast axis.  The fill was
comprised of a single zone, a light brown loam mottled with orange clay.  In
the first 0.8 ft, an occasional, poorly preserved animal bone was encountered.
At a depth of about one foot, a thicker concentration of animal bone as well as
other artifacts was noted.  Most of the bone was deer except for three intact
turtle shell carapaces.  In this same general area were several glass trade
beads, a kaolin-clay pipe bowl with a split stem, three gunflints, and a large
polished-stone disk.  A concentration of large Fredricks Checked Stamped
potsherds was uncovered at this same depth along the eastern edge of the pit.<p>

	Unfortunately, the pit was flooded before excavation was completed, making the
lower pit sides and bottom difficult to define. The east wall and a portion of
the bottom near the center probably were cut through by the excavators.  After
excavation, the feature measured 3.7 ft by 3.2 ft and was 2.1 ft deep.<p>

	The function of this pit is enigmatic.  Apparently, the pit was dug, perhaps
for storage purposes or even as a burial container, and then rapidly filled
with the same excavated soil.  Just before the fill reached the top, a variety
of trade artifacts, animal bones, and a broken pot were tossed in.
Subsequently, the filling process continued with the same soil.<p>
