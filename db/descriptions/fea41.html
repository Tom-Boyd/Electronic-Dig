	This roughly circular feature was located at 288.5R5.0, between Structure 5
and the village palisade.  It measured 3.5 ft by 3.2 ft and had a maximum depth
of 1.9 ft.  At subsoil, the feature appeared as a circular stain of dark brown
organic fill (Zone 1) with animal bones, charcoal, and several potsherds,
including parts of two Fredricks Plain jars
(<a href="../excavations/slid_baq.html" target="body"><u>first</u></a>,
<a href="../excavations/slid_bar.html" target="body"><u>second</u></a>).  A
metal pipe-bowl liner, glass beads, and clay pipe fragments also were found.  A
concentration of burned and unburned animal bones was located near the bottom
of this zone.  Several large rocks and potsherds were also associated with the
burned bones.  A second zone (Zone 2), comprised of mottled yellowish orange
clay, was noted along the pit walls on the northern and southwestern sides of
the feature.  Underlying Zones 1 and 2, was Zone 3, a reddish brown, ashy loam
with charcoal, burned clay, burned bone, and potsherds.  This zone was
particularly rich in charred plant remains and animal bone.  It also contained
an iron axe head, several clay pipe fragments, fire-cracked rocks, glass beads,
and an ivory rosary bead.  Zone 1 was 1.2 ft thick, whereas Zone 3 averaged 0.7
ft thick.  Pit walls were straight and the bottom was flat.<p>
