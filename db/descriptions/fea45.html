	Feature 45 was located just northeast of Structure 13 at 207.5R58.8.  This pit
was observed at the subsoil surface as a circular stain of brown humus that
contained animal bone and charcoal.  The brown humus comprised the only fill
zone within the pit, and it was particularly rich in animal bone and
European-made artifacts.  The latter include a bone-handled knife, gunflint,
kaolin-clay pipe fragments, an iron blade, and numerous pieces of lead shot and
glass beads.  The fill also contained two clusters of <a href="../excavations/slid_bav.html" target="body"><u>large fitting pottery
sherds</u></a>.<p>

	The pit walls were straight and the bottom was flat.  After excavation, it
measured 2.6 ft in diameter and was 1.5 ft deep.  The relatively shallow depth
of the feature would seem to preclude its use as a storage facility.  The
homogeneity of the fill indicates that it was refilled rapidly with household
refuse, perhaps representing a single dumping episode.<p>
