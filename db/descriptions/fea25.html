	Feature 24 was located within Structure 5 at 286.0R28.5.  This feature was
evident at the top of the subsoil as a large oval stain that measured 4.3 ft by
2.2 ft; however, it had a maximum depth of only 0.5 ft.  An apparent intrusion
at the northwest end of the feature was excavated first.  The fill in this
intrusion was a dark yellowish brown soil which contrasted with the grayish tan
fill of the remainder of the feature.  Flecks of charcoal and small bits of red
clay were noted throughout the fill.<p>
