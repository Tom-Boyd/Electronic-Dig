	Feature 10 was located near <a href="../excavations/exc_iy.html" target="_top"><u>Structure 3</u></a> at 251.6R70.0.  This was a deep
cylindrical pit with undercut walls that gave it a bell-shaped profile.  This
feature was 2.6 ft long, 2.3 ft wide, and was 3.1 ft deeper than the top of
subsoil.  The depth-to-diameter ratio (1.55) and volume (18.54 ft<sup>3</sup>)
suggest that the pit was used for storage of food or other materials.  It
probably served as the primary subterranean storage facility for members of the
Structure 3 household.<p>

	Feature 10 contained two zones of fill.  The upper zone, Zone 1, was a dark
brown loam that contained a variety of cultural remains.  These remains
consisted of potsherds, lithic artifacts, kaolin-clay pipe fragments, glass
trade beads, animal bone, wood charcoal, and charred plant food remains.  Deer
was the only identifiable animal species represented.  The plant remains
recovered were hickory nut, acorn, peach, and corn; wood charcoal also was
fairly abundant.  The lower portion of this zone contained most of the above
material, as well as a small concentration of fire-cracked rock, charcoal, and
sandy ash.  The fill probably represents a brief disposal episode of household
debris, including hearth materials.  Zone 2 was a deposit of dark,
brownish-orange, mottled clay loam that extended to the bottom of the pit.
This zone was about 2.5 ft thick and contained over 700 g of animal bone
fragments representing deer, box turtle, squirrel, and turkey.  A small amount
of plant food remains were recovered, consisting of hickory nut and a trace of
corn.  Wood charcoal was well preserved but in a smaller amount than in the
overlying zone. Potsherds were more abundant than in Zone 1.  Zone 2 seems to
represent the initial filling of this pit upon its abandonment as a storage
facility.  A lack of lenses in the fill suggests that it accumulated fairly
rapidly.  It is not possible to determine the origin of this fill, although its
mottled color and variety of cultural debris may identify it as a redeposited
mixture of humus soil, midden, and clay subsoil.<p>
