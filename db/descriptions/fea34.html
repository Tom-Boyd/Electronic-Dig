	This feature represents the remnants of the central hearth associated with
Structure 5.  It was centered at 286.0R22.3.  The main body of the hearth has
been destroyed by plowing, and Feature 34 represents only small fragments of
burned clay that formed the base of the hearth.  It measured 3.2 ft by 3.1 ft
on the subsoil surface.  A concentration of fired clay particles also was
observed in the plowzone directly above Feature 34.<p>
