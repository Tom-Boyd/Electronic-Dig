	Feature 17 was an almost circular pit located within Structure 9 at
233.5R77.5.  It measured 2.7 ft by 2.4 ft in plan view and was 2.1 ft deep.  In
profile, the pit was barrel-shaped with walls that sloped slightly inward at
the top and bottom.  The pit fill consisted of three zones.  The upper zone
(Zone 1) was about one foot thick and contained dark brown loam with charcoal.
Scattered throughout this zone, there were also pockets of orange-yellow clay.
Beneath Zone 1 was a thick (1.1 ft) layer of gray ashy soil (Zone 2) which
extended to the bottom of the pit.  This soil was loosely packed, damp, and
contained a large number of animal bones and artifacts (e.g., glass trade
beads, lead shot, charcoal, a clay pipe bowl, a case knife, an ember tender,
stone and pottery disks, numerous potsherds [including part of a <a href="../excavations/slid_bak.html" target="body"><u>Fredricks
Plain jar</u></a>], a
hammerstone, a chunkey stone, stone flakes, and chipped stone projectile
points).  This storage pit had been backfilled in at least two episodes of
refuse disposal.<p>
