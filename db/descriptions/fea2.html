<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Feature 2 (Burial 4) was located near the center of the cemetery at
293.5R76.5.  This burial pit was visible at the top of the subsoil as a
rectangular stain with slightly rounded corners.  The center portion of the pit
was comprised of dark brown humic soil with charcoal, animal bone and
potsherds.  This fill is similar to the Zone 1 fill of Burials 1, 2, and 3; a
mottled orange clay formed a band around the perimeter of the pit.  The pit,
whose main axis was northwest-southeast, measured 3.2 ft by 2.2 ft across the
top and was 2.1 ft deep.  The pit walls were straight, and the bottom was flat
except for a ledge along the northeast side.  It is again proposed that metal
implements were used to excavate this pit.  A dark brown fill (Zone 1) extended
unevenly across the middle portion of the pit to a depth of a little over one
foot.  This was underlain by a mottled orange clay fill (Zone 2) that contained
some of the darker soil near the top.<p>

<i>Burial Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	One of two skeletons in the pit was that of an adult male, 25 +/- 4 years old
at death, that had been disarticulated and placed in a tight bundle lying
against the southwest wall of the pit.  The ledge at the bottom of the pit
paralleled the orientation of the body.  Cut marks around the cranium suggest
that this individual was scalped.  Mixed with the bundle were the skeletal
remains of an infant who was about one month old at death.  Because these
remains were not discovered until the adult burial was being cleaned in the
laboratory, it is impossible to know the precise spatial relationship of the
two individuals.<p>

<i>Grave Goods</i><p>
<p>
	A cluster of 11 long, tubular, <a href="../excavations/slid_aib.html" target="body"><u>columella beads</u></a> were located within the chest area of the bundle
and unquestionably were associated with it.  A <a href="../excavations/slid_alu.html" target="body"><u>wine
bottle</u></a> was found in
the southeast corner of the pit next to the adult skull, and a <a href="../excavations/slid_agw.html" target="body"><u>pewter
porringer</u></a> was found
at the foot of the bundle adjacent to and on the northeast side of the long
bones.  Based on the fact that a wine bottle also was found with <a href="../excavations/exc_ac.html" target="_top"><u>Burial
3</u></a>, an adult,
it is probable that the bottle in Burial 4 was meant to accompany the adult.
The porringer, on the other hand, may have been placed with the infant, because
a similar specimen was found with <a href="../excavations/exc_ab.html" target="_top"><u>Burial 2</u></a>, a subadult.<p>
