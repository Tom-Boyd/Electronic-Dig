	This was an irregular-shaped, shallow, oval basin located just inside the
village palisade and east of Structure 6 at 308.2R39.8.  It measured 2.1 ft by
1.6 ft in plan view and had a maximum depth of 0.7 ft.  It appeared at the top
of the subsoil as a patch of dark yellowish brown soil.  This soil, which
continued to the bottom of the pit, contained a few large potsherds, pieces of
quartz, animal bone, stone flakes, and charcoal.  Pit walls sloped slightly
inward, giving the feature a basin shape.<p>
