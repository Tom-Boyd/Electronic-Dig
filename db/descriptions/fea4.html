<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Feature 4 (Burial 6) was located near the center of the cemetery at
300.6R75.7.  Evidence of this burial pit appeared in the plowzone as an area of
dark brown soil containing animal bones, potsherds, and charcoal. At the top of
the subsoil, the pit was rectangular in outline and measured 5.6 ft by 4 ft.
It extended to a depth of 2.3 ft below the top of the subsoil.  The major axis
was northwest-southeast.  Three of the walls sloped slightly inward at the
bottom.  The northeast wall was undercut at the bottom, creating a long narrow
chamber.  As with the other burials within the cemetery, it apparently was
excavated with iron tools.  When first observed at the top of the subsoil, the
rectangular pit had a central zone of dark brown humic loam with pebbles (Zone
1).  This dark zone was surrounded by a collar of mottled orange and brown clay
(Zone 2), which in turn was encircled by more brown humic loam that contained
some clay mottling (Zone 3).  Beneath these fairly shallow zones (with a
combined thickness of 0.5 ft) was a mottled orange clay (Zone 4) similar to
Zone 2 in most of the other cemetery burials.  The final zone (Zone 5) lay over
the body and consisted of a dark brown humus.  The majority of food refuse was
found in the west-central band of Zone 1.  In general, the zones of fill in
this burial were more convoluted and harder to separate than those in the other
pits.<p>

<i>Body Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	Initial osteological analysis indicated the skeleton was that of an adult male
between 25 and 35 years old at the time of death.  However, a reassessment of
Burial 6 determined that the individual may have been female and was only 19
+/- 3 years old at death.  The skeleton was loosely flexed and lying on the
right side with the elbows bent and the hands opposite the face.  As with the
other cemetery burials, the skull was pointing to the southeast.<p>

	Accompanying the burial were a <a href="../excavations/slid_amj.html" target="body"><u>clay pot</u></a> lying behind the skull, a <a href="../excavations/slid_akk.html" target="body"><u>pewter pipe
stem</u></a> and bowl rim
between the face and hands, a large <a href="../excavations/slid_all.html" target="body"><u>iron hoe</u></a> near the feet, and a <a href="../excavations/slid_bkl.html" target="body"><u>dog-lock
musket</u></a> lying parallel
to the northeast side of the body.  There was a leather-covered copper-wire
<a href="../excavations/slid_bey.html" target="body"><u>bracelet</u></a> around
the left wrist.  A pair of <a href="../excavations/slid_aki.html" target="body"><u>scissors</u></a> and a piece of lead shot were found beneath and
immediately north of the pot.  Glass beads were located under the pottery
vessel and at each heel.  Other glass beads were found under the copper
bracelet.<p>
