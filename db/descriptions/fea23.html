	Feature 46 was located northwest of Structure 13 at 211.5R34.5.  Prior to
excavation, this pit appeared as an oval-shaped stain of dark brown loam with
charcoal flecks and mottled orange clay.  The outer perimeter of the stain
consisted of a thin zone of lighter mottled soil that represented smear from
the main body of the feature.  The soil (labeled Zone 1) that appeared at the
base of the plowzone continued to the bottom of the pit.  It was homogeneous
except for an occasional lump or small pocket of orange clay.  Cultural
material consisted primarily of animal bone.  Relatively few artifacts were
recovered other than a few European and aboriginal clay pipe fragments, lead
shot, potsherds, glass beads, a hammerstone, and a possible grinding stone.<p>

	The feature was slightly barrel shaped, had a flat bottom, and measured 2.6 ft
by 2.4 ft.  It reached a depth below the subsoil of 2.0 ft.  The fill was
deposited in the pit over a short period of time soon after it was abandoned as
a storage facility.  The character of the fill is suggestive of general village
midden.<p>
