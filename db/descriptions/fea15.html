	Feature 15, a tree stump hole, was located outside the village palisade and
north of the cemetery at 318.8R69.3.  Its maximum dimensions were 2.6 ft by 1.5
ft in plan view, and it had a depth of 1.4 ft.  This feature was observed at
the top of the subsoil as an irregular reddish brown loamy stain (Zone 1) with
small patches of yellowish red mottled clay in the southeast corner and along
the northeast edge.  Flakes of charcoal and small pebbles were observed in the
top portion of Zone 1; however, the fill quickly changed to a reddish yellow
clay.  This zone was devoid of artifacts although flecks of burned clay were
encountered near the bottom of the pit.  The irregular configuration of the
feature continued as it was excavated, and the bottom was uneven with several
cone-shaped depressions representing root channels.<p>
