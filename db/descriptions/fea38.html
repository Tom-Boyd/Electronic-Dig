	This feature was a shallow, oval pit located just outside the village palisade
at 305.5R11.5.  It measured 2.5 ft by 1.3 ft in plan view and had a maximum
depth of 0.3 ft.  The fill consisted of swirls of mottled orange clay with some
charcoal flecks.  It contained a glass bead, a few potsherds, and animal bones.
The sides sloped inward in all directions, creating a conical profile.<p>
