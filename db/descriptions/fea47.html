	Feature 47 was located northeast of Structure 13 at 203.8R62.5.  This pit was
observed at the base of the plowzone as a roughly circular patch of dark brown
sandy soil (Zone 1) that contained several animal bone fragments, charcoal, and
pockets of ash.  Toward the outer edge of the feature, the soil was lighter in
color; a small pocket of yellow mottled fill was located along the southern
edge.  Except for the bone, relatively few artifacts were contained within Zone
1.  European artifacts consisted of a few glass beads and one piece of lead
shot.  This upper zone was approximately 0.6 ft thick and overlay Zone 2, which
was defined by mottled clay with a mixture of sand, orange clay, ash, and some
darker soil similar to Zone 1.  This fill contained numerous animal bones and
many more potsherds than the upper zone.  In addition, pockets of ash and sand
were noted throughout Zone 2. European-made artifacts from this zone consisted
of glass trade beads.<p>

	The walls of the pit sloped inward at the bottom, giving it a barrel-shaped
profile.  The bottom was flat and extended to a depth of 1.6 ft below the
subsoil surface.  The top of the pit measured 2.6 by 2.7 ft.<p>

	This feature may have originally served as a shallow storage pit or perhaps as
a soil recovery facility.  In either case, it was ultimately filled with
household refuse, consisting primarily of animal bones.  The ash, sand, and
charcoal deposits indicate that hearth areas within structures were also
cleaned and their contents dumped into the pit along with the other debris.<p>
