	Feature 1 was located near the southeast end of the cemetery at 282.7R80.7.
It measured 3.9 ft long by 2.9 ft wide, and it was 2.8 ft deep.  At the top of
subsoil, this feature was very similar in appearance to other nearby burial
pits within the cemetery.  It appeared as a rectangular patch of dark brown
soil (designated Zone 1) that contained numerous fragments of animal bone,
charcoal, shell, burned clay, pottery, and fire-broken rock, and it was
oriented along a northwest-southeast axis.  Zone 1 was about one foot thick and
was underlain by a mottled clay fill designated Zone 2.  This zone contained
significantly fewer artifacts.<p>

	Along the southwestern side of the pit bottom, the excavators encountered an
area of softer, organically enriched fill which they interpreted as a probable
burial chamber; however, no human bone or funerary objects were found.  Despite
this, the location, pit shape, and fill characteristics of this feature all
indicate that it is a burial pit.<p>
