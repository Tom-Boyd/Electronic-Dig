<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Feature 3 (Burial 5) was located near the center of the cemetery at
299.2R69.5.  The pit for Burial 5 was visible at the top of subsoil as a
rectangular area of dark brown, charcoal-flecked fill surrounded by an
irregular band of mottled orange fill.  In plan view, the configuration of this
fill resembled that of <a href="../excavations/exc_ao.html" target="_top"><u>Burial 4</u></a>.  The pit was rectangular in
outline, with its main axis oriented northwest-southeast.  It measured 5.1 ft
in length, 2.9 ft in width, and had a maximum depth of 2.0 ft.  The pit corners
were slightly rounded, and three of the walls were straight.  The northeast
wall, however, was undercut at the bottom of the pit creating a small side
chamber.  The bottom was flat and smooth, indicating the use of iron tools.<p>
<p>
	The burial fill consisted of two primary zones.  The upper zone (Zone 1),
which comprised the central two-thirds of the pit, was composed of a dark brown
loam with an ashy gray lens near the center.  This central lens was nearly 1 ft
thick.  Zone 1 contained charcoal, chunks of burned clay, shell, and both
burned and unburned animal bone.  Although the dark fill was homogeneous at the
top, it became more mottled and blended into a zone of mottled orange clay
(Zone 2) near the bottom.  Zone 2 contained lenses of dark organic fill and
ashy deposits similar to Zone 1.  These deposits extended down to the top of
the skeleton in the area between the arms and skull and near the thoracic
vertebra.  A group of large mammal bones in this fill made it difficult for the
excavators to isolate the human skeletal remains.  However, the mottled orange
clay comprised the largest volume of fill in Zone 2 and extended over most of
the skeleton.  It also extended to the top edge of the pit, forming a broken
ring around the dark organic fill.<p>

<i>Body Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	The body was that of an adult male who was 41 +/- 9 years old at death.  The
skeleton was loosely flexed and lying on its right side, with the skull to the
southwest.  The arms were bent with the hands in front of the face.  The body
was placed in the northwest half of the pit.<p>

<i>Grave Goods</i><p>
<p>
	The remains of a <a href="../excavations/slid_agx.html" target="body"><u>pouch</u></a> decorated with wampum shell beads and a bird's clay contained
two kaolin-clay trade pipes and a bone-handled iron knife.  The pouch lay
adjacent to the elbow. An iron axe head lay in the area between the elbows and
knees.<p>
