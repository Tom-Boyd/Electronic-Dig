	This roughly circular, cob-filled pit was located at 307.8R36.6, measured 0.9
ft by 0.8 ft in plan view, and was 0.6 ft deep.  It was the northernmost of
three small pits (Feature 35, <a href="../excavations/exc_bg.html" target="_top"><u>Feature 36</u></a>, and <a href="../excavations/exc_bh.html" target="_top"><u>Feature
37</u></a>) aligned
northeast-southwest and it intruded the Structure 6 wall trench.  Fill was a
mottled orange soil with dense charcoal comprised of wood and corncobs.  The
pit was conical in profile.<p>
