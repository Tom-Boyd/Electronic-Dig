<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Feature 27 (Burial 10), located at the northwestern end of the cemetery at
316.5R53.2, was aligned along a northwest-southeast axis like the other
cemetery graves.  The rectangular pit measured 3.5 ft long by 2.8 ft wide and
was 2.9 ft deep.  At the base of the plowzone, the pit appeared as a
rectangular stain of dark gray soil that contained numerous fragmented animal
bones, pottery sherds, and small pebbles.  This upper fill zone (Zone 1) was
approximately 2 ft deep and covered a mottled orange clay (Zone 2) with pockets
of dark gray fill at the northeast and southwest ends of the pit.  Zone 2
extended 0.9 ft to the floor of the pit where several patches of preserved
matting were encountered.  The walls of the pit were straight and the bottom
was flat.<p>

<i>Body Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	The poorly preserved skeletal remains in Burial 10 were from a sub-adult who
was 4.5 years +/- 16 months old at the time of death.  The body was loosely
flexed and lying on its left side.<p>

<i>Grave Goods</i><p>
<p>
	Artifacts accompanying the burial included a cluster of three broken clay pots
(<a href="../excavations/slid_alt.html" target="body"><u>first</u></a>,
<a href="../excavations/slid_bao.html" target="body"><u>second</u></a>,
<a href="../excavations/slid_als.html" target="body"><u>third</u></a>) just west
of the skull.  Three pieces of lead shot were found beneath the sherd matrix.
A concentration of white, red, and blue glass trade beads were found near the
skull in the area of the pots, and there were white glass trade beads on the
skull itself.  Immediately southeast of the skull, lying together, were a
<a href="../excavations/slid_alp.html" target="body"><u>greenstone celt</u></a> and an iron hoe blade.  South of the body was a turtle carapace cup, and lying
between the legs were nine <a href="../excavations/slid_alb.html" target="body"><u>brass bells</u></a>.  In addition to the artifacts, there were large
patches of fiber matting along the bottom of the pit, indicating that the
individual was wrapped prior to interment.<p>
