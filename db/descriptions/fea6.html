<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Feature 6 (Burial 8) was located near the northwest end of the cemetery at
306.5R61.7.  When first observed at the top of the subsoil, this pit consisted
of a rectangular stain of mostly brown loamy soil (Zone 1).  The excavated pit
measured 4.0 ft by 2.5 ft and was aligned with the long axis running
northwest-southeast.  A depth of 2.5 ft made it the second deepest pit in the
cemetery.  The sides were straight and not undercut to form a chamber as with
many of the other burial pits.  An uppermost brown loamy soil (Zone 1)
contained numerous pebbles, and there was a dense concentration of animal bone
and charcoal in the northwestern corner.  A small patch of mottled orange and
brown clay was located near the center of the top of the pit.  The dark loamy
soil, mixed with lenses of mottled clay comprising four zones, extended to a
depth of approximately 1.0 ft.  Below this was a thick zone of mottled orange
clay that represented the original fill.  Although this latter zone was fairly
homogenous, a finger of the brown loam comprising Zone 1 continued to the floor
of the pit along the southern wall.<p>

<i>Body Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	The pit contained the poorly preserved skeleton of a child of indeterminate
sex who was 3.5 +/- 1 years old at death.  The skeleton was loosely flexed on
its left side, with the skull to the southeast.  The hands lay on the chest.<p>

<i>Grave Goods</i><p>
<p>
	A <a href="../excavations/slid_agv.html" target="body"><u>copper kettle</u></a> was positioned between the feet and pelvis.  Several small lumps of vermillion
or red ochre were found beneath the chin, and a <a href="../excavations/slid_akp.html" target="body"><u>brass
buckle</u></a> with part of
a leather strap attached had been placed near the arms.  Most interesting was a
cluster of artifacts located in the southwest corner of the pit opposite the
skull.  This cluster consisted of a small Fredricks Check Stamped <a href="../excavations/slid_alr.html" target="body"><u>clay
pot</u></a> flanked by a
bone-handled <a href="../excavations/slid_ako.html" target="body"><u>iron knife</u></a>, a latten spoon, and a brass buckle.  All these objects had
been placed in a twilled, <a href="../excavations/slid_bbz.html" target="body"><u>split-cane basket</u></a>, a portion of which was well preserved beneath the
spoon bowl.<p>
