	Feature 9 was a large, deep, cylindrical pit located within Structure 1 at
247.4R56.6.  The pit was 5.0 ft long, 4.7 ft wide, and 2.9 ft deep below
subsoil.  A massive rock that extended into the pit on the south side appeared
to have been heated repeatedly.  Feature 9 is an excellent example of a pit
facility that may have undergone several transformations in its function prior
to its abandonment.  The fill zones of this feature reflect these potential
transformations. <p>
<p>
	The bottom zone (Zone 3b) consisted of masses of charred bark and clusters of
carbonized corn kernels, all on the pit floor.  The masses of corn had been
contained in woven baskets, portions of which were recovered during excavation.
These baskets seem to have been intentionally placed on the pit floor around
the inside perimeter adjacent to the walls.  The pit floor beneath the bark
lining, as well as the lower pit walls, was colored brick-red from having been
fired.  The only animal remains from this zone were numerous fragments of
charred foot bones from an unidentified small mammal.  A few flakes and small
glass trade beads also were found.<p>
<p>
	If Feature 9 had functioned as a storage facility the bark lining and corn
could represent materials that were left in place when the first observable
transformation of the facility occurred.  Although most corn was probably
stored on the husk, Harrington observed that the Seneca stored roasted and
dried green corn in bags (<a href="../part6/ref_ed.html" target="_top"><u>Harrington 1908b</u></a>:589).<p>
<p>
	An alternative interpretation of Zone 3b is that it represents initial
preparation of the feature for use as a fire pit (This does not rule out the
possibility that the pit was originally used for storage).  The containers of
corn kernels may reflect ritual behavior associated with feasts of thanksgiving
at the end of the corn harvest, such as those described by Lawson (<a href="../part6/ref_ad.html" target="_top"><u>Lefler
1967</u></a>:67, 177).  Such harvest ceremonies were common throughout much of North
America (<a href="../part6/ref_bu.html" target="_top"><u>Hudson 1976</u></a>). <p>
<p>
	Zone 3a accumulated on top of Zone 3b.  This zone reflects repeated episodes
of fire building.  Numerous fire-cracked rocks and uncracked hearth stones were
present in this zone.  Associated with these hearth stones were a damaged and
burnt steel axe head, several lumps of sand-tempered potter's clay, and a small
hammerstone.  One of the large rocks showed evidence of having been used as a
grinding stone.  These items were contained within a rich organic, ashy-clay
loam matrix. Numerous lenses of brick-red fired clay were present throughout
this zone as were many fragments of charred wood and bark.  The soil matrix,
rocks, fired clay, and fire-reddened and hardened pit walls and floor strongly
suggest that this zone of fill accumulated in-place as a result of repeated
fires. <p>
<p>
	The plant food remains from this zone were both abundant and diverse.  This
seems to imply that plant food preparation on a large scale might have been an
important behavioral component in the formation of this zone.  However, it is
possible that much of the corn (which represents 68% of the plant food remains
by weight) might have originated from the same activities that produced the
corn kernel clusters in the underlying zone.  Although there was a diverse
assemblage of seeds present in the fill, most of these seeds were of weedy
species and could have been introduced into the fill by natural processes.  It
fact, an open fire pit might be expected to "capture" an assortment of seeds
from nearby plant communities.  The other seeds represented in this zone were
grape, maypops, and sumac, all of which could have been consumed while people
were sitting within Structure 1 taking sweat baths. <p>
<p>
	Zone 2, a mottled clay loam, contained a mixture of cultural materials,
including potsherds, lithic artifacts, animal bone fragments, glass trade
beads, wood charcoal, and charred plant food remains.  The mottled composition
of the fill suggests that it was a mixture of subsoil and humus excavated to
fill the pit after it ceased to function as a fire pit.  This zone was more
organically rich where it was bounded by the underlying and overlying zones of
rich organic material.  All of the species of plant food remains from this fill
were present in the overlying Zone 1 deposit and may have originated from the
same activity that produced that zone.  Zone 2 extended to the top of the
feature (base of the plowzone).  At that level it appeared as a 0.3-ft ring
surrounding a central ashy deposit (Zone 1).<p>
<p>
	The upper zone of fill (Zone 1) was a basin-shaped deposit of dark,
yellowish-brown sandy ash containing a mixture of diverse plant and animal
remains, along with a variety of artifacts.  The artifacts within this zone
consisted of potsherds, lithic debris and tools, glass trade beads, kaolin pipe
fragments, wood charcoal, fired clay, and daub.  This zone was a very
homogeneous and fine-grained deposit of ash.  There was a relatively high
percentage of plant food remains, which included hickory nutshell, acorn shell,
peach pits, walnut shells, corn, grape seeds, and maypops seeds.  A variety of
other carbonized seeds representing non-plant food remains were also present.
Four species of animals (deer, raccoon, bear, and a single horse molar) were
represented as bone fragments in the fill.  The textural qualities of the fill
and the relatively small amounts of nonbotanical remains represented in the
flotation sample suggest that this zone accumulated in situ.  The basin shape
of the deposit probably resulted from partial re-excavation (cleaning out) of
the pit aboriginally.  The large and diverse assemblage of plant food remains
imply that this facility may have been used for the large scale preparation of
food, perhaps with feasting that occurred as part of the mortuary practices of
the occupants of the village.<p>
