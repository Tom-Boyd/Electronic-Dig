<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Feature 26 (Burial 13) was located near the northwestern end of the cemetery
at 312.0R58.0.  As with the other burials in the cemetery, the pit was
rectangular in plan;  it measured 4.6 ft by 3.2 ft and was 2.3 ft deep.  At the
top-of-subsoil level, the pit appeared as a stain of mottled gray-brown soil
with lenses of orange clay (Zone 1).  This zone was 0.8 ft thick.  In contrast
to the upper fill zones in most of the cemetery burials, Burial 13 contained
only a few poorly preserved animal bones and not many artifacts.  Perhaps the
feasting activities associated with this interment were not as elaborate or
intense as was characteristic of many of the other burials.  Beneath Zone 1 was
an almost sterile mottled clay layer approximately 1.0 ft thick (Zone 2).  The
final zone, Zone 3, averaged 0.5 ft thick, had a clay-like consistency, and was
very similar to Zone 2.  Although few artifacts were found, all the zones
contained a large number of pebbles and rock chips.  The pit walls were
straight but sloped inward slightly to join the flat bottom.<p>

<i>Body Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	The skeleton was that of an adult male who was 40 +/- 5 years old at death.
The body was loosely flexed and placed on its right side.  Bone preservation
was generally poor.<p>
<p>
<i>Grave Goods</i><p>
<p>
	A small cluster of artifacts, including a bone-handled case
<a href="../excavations/slid_akz.html" target="body"><u>knife</u></a>, pewter
porringer, and a kaolin-clay pipe, lay adjacent to the left lower arm.  A
second bone-handled case knife was located near the skull, in front of the
face.  These were the only artifacts associated with the burial other than
small bits of vermillion in the soil around the skull.<p>
