	Feature 8 was located just east of Structure 7 at 290.0R58.0.  At the top of
subsoil, this feature appeared as an irregular patch of brown loam, about 2.0
ft in diameter, that contained bits of charcoal, animal bone, fired clay, and a
large net-impressed rimsherd.  This fill was designated Zone 1, and it was
surrounded by a yellow-gray sandy clay (designated Zone 2) that contained small
flecks of charcoal.  Both zones extended about 1.5 ft below the subsoil
surface.  At this level three root holes about 0.4 ft in diameter became
visible and it was determined that Feature 8 was a tree disturbance.  Given the
presence of Haw River phase (A.D. 1000-1400) pottery within the fill and the
absence of European-made artifacts and Fredricks series pottery, this
disturbance likely predates the Occaneechi village.<p>
