	Feature 57 was located between Structure 12 and Structure 13 at 215.9R26.3.
This cylindrical pit contained a single fill zone consisting of a mottled brown
and yellow clay.  Artifacts included a few pottery sherds, glass beads, and
poorly preserved fragments of animal bone.  These were concentrated at the top
and bottom of the pit where the organic content was slightly higher.<p>

	The pit walls were straight and sloped into a flat bottom at a depth of 1.3
ft.  The feature measured 2.4 ft by 2.3 ft across the top.  It appears to have
been filled rapidly with a homogenous clay subsoil mixed with a small amount of
surface dirt.  Although the pit may have originally served as a storage
facility, it is relatively shallow compared with other features interpreted as
storage pits.<p>
