	Feature 40 was a small, shallow basin measuring 1.3 ft by 1.0 ft by 0.2 ft
deep.  It was centered at 318.5R33.5.  Fill consisted of a slightly mottled
orange and brown loam with small amounts of charcoal.  The sides sloped inward
creating a basin-shaped profile.  This feature was located inside <a href="../excavations/exc_iz.html" target="_top"><u>Structure
4</u></a> and
appears to be associated with it.<p>
