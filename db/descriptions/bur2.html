<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Burial 2 was located near the southeast end of the cemetery at 279.3R85.8.
The pit was visible at the base of the plowzone as a rectangular stain
comprised of a medium-to-dark brown gritty sandy fill with a large amount of
charcoal.  A thin mottled orange collar was evident along the northwest and
southwest edge of the stain.  The pit was oriented northwest-southeast,
measured 3.1 ft long and 2.6 ft wide, and had a rectangular plan.  It extended
to a depth of 2.1 ft below the base of the plowzone.  Two postholes, one along
the southwest edge and the other midway along the northeast edge, intruded the
pit edge.  The sides were straight, except for the northeast wall, which was
undercut to create a bell-shaped bulge at the bottom of the pit.  The pit
bottom was flat and smooth, which suggests that metal implements were used in
its excavation.<p>
<p>
	The fill was excavated as two separate zones.  The top zone (Zone 1) consisted
of a brown gritty or sandy humic soil that was rich in refuse, including
potsherds, some animal bone, and carbonized plant remains.  This zone was very
similar to Zone 1 in <a href="../excavations/exc_aa.html" target="_top"><u>Burial 1</u></a> except that it was not as rich in animal
bone and was thicker (extending about 1 ft below the base of plowzone).  The
bottom of this zone was mottled and contained lenses of ash and charcoal.  Zone
2 was a mottled yellow clay containing some charcoal that extended to the
bottom of the pit.  It was roughly 1.5 ft thick.<p>

<i>Burial Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	The burial was that of a subadult of indeterminate sex who was 7.5 +/- 2 years
old at death.  The skeleton was loosely flexed and lying on the right side,
with the skull oriented to the southeast.  The arms were bent with the hands
lying in front of the face.<p>

<i>Grave Goods</i><p>
<p>
	A <a href="../excavations/slid_bby.html" target="body"><u>bundle</u></a> of
artifacts believed to have been contained in a beaded bag was located on the
left side of the chest.  That bundle contained a Jew's harp, several pieces of
lead shot, three lead buttons, and three unidentified fragments of iron.
Several small white glass beads, thought to have been sewn on the bag, were
located in the same area.  A bone-handled <a href="../excavations/slid_ajl.html" target="body"><u>knife</u></a> also may have been part of the bundle.  Between
this cluster of artifacts and the pit wall was a small, Fredricks Check Stamped
<a href="../excavations/slid_aug.html" target="body"><u>pottery vessel</u></a>.
The pot was lying on its side and contained a dark stain around the orifice,
perhaps the residue of food originally placed in the vessel.  Next to the back
of the skull lay a pewter <a href="../excavations/slid_agu.html" target="body"><u>porringer</u></a>.  Another bone-handled
<a href="../excavations/slid_ajm.html" target="body"><u>knife</u></a> and a
cluster of small shell beads were observed adjacent to the wrists on the right
side of the burial.  Large columella beads were found in the neck area.<p>
