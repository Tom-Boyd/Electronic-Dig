	This shallow, circular basin measured 2.3 ft in diameter and was 0.6 ft deep.
It was located near the center of the palisaded village at 252.2R48.5.  The
fill consisted of a sandy, bright yellow soil that was homogeneous and sterile
except for small flecks of charcoal.  The pit walls sloped inward at the bottom
to create a conical profile.<p>
