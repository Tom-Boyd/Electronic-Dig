	Feature 11 was located near <a href="../excavations/exc_iy.html" target="_top"><u>Structure 3 </u></a>at 249.5R77.4.  This small, oval, deep,
refuse-filled pit was 3.0 ft long, 2.4 ft wide, and 1.5 ft in depth below the
top of subsoil.  A large rock extended into the pit from the surrounding
subsoil and the pit wall had been undercut around this rock, perhaps in an
attempt to remove it.  The pit had a depth-to-diameter ratio of 0.80 and
probably functioned as a small storage facility.  The small volume (10.8
ft<sup>3</sup>) suggests that it was not used for bulk storage, but rather that
it may have functioned as a cache for non-food items. <p>

	Feature 11 contained a single zone of brown, sandy clay loam with charcoal and
fired clay.  This fill contained only a small amount of plant remains (0.01 g
of hickory nutshell per 10-liter flotation sample).  Animal remains were
present but in very poor condition; only 13 of 94 fragments were identified,
all of which were deer remains.  Other cultural materials consisted of
potsherds, stone flakes, rocks, kaolin-clay pipe fragments, and glass trade
beads.  The sloped bottom of the pit give it a somewhat "unfinished" appearance
and it may have been considered unsuitable as a storage pit once the rock was
encountered and efforts to remove it failed.<p>
