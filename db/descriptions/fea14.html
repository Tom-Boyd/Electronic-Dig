<i>Pit Morphology</i><p>
<p>
	Feature 14 (Burial 11) was located near the northwest end of the cemetery at
315.2R66.2.  This burial pit, measuring 4.9 ft long by 3.1 ft wide, and 3.1 ft
deep, was first observed as a soil stain of dark brown, ashy clay loam
containing numerous animal bones, charcoal, pebbles, and pottery sherds.  The
upper fill, designated Zone 1, was 1.1 ft thick.  Beneath Zone 1 was Zone 2, a
brown, mottled, orange clay loam that contained lenses of mottled clay.  The
northwest two-thirds of Zone 2 contained a large amount of burned animal bone,
charcoal, and other organic matter, and was similar to Zone 1.  The southeast
one-third of the zone, however, was comprised of an almost sterile mottled clay
fill.  The bottom zone, Zone 3, was a mottled dark loam with orange clay
lenses.  It was 0.5 ft thick and surrounded the body.  Three of the pit walls
sloped inward to intersect the flat pit bottom; however, the northwest wall was
undercut slightly near the floor.<p>

<i>Body Deposition</i><p>
<p>
	The poorly preserved skeleton was of a young adult of indeterminate sex who
was 17 +/- 3 years old at death.  The body was loosely flexed and lay on its
right side.<p>

<i>Grave Goods</i><p>

Several artifacts associated with the burial were in clusters and appear to
represent separate bundles or containers.  The first
<a href="../excavations/slid_bez.html" target="body"><u>cluster</u></a>, located
near the feet, contained several Cornaline d'Aleppo beads, vermillion and red
lead, <a href="../excavations/slid_aky.html" target="body"><u>wire C-bracelets</u></a>, and a <a href="../excavations/slid_aku.html" target="body"><u>snuff tin</u></a>.  An adjacent cluster contained a case knife, <a href="../excavations/slid_akx.html" target="body"><u>Jews
harps</u></a>, and pieces of
<a href="../excavations/slid_akv.html" target="body"><u>lead shot</u></a>.  A
cluster of Cornaline d'Aleppo beads was located adjacent to the right knee.  In
addition to these three artifact clusters, four <a href="../excavations/slid_akw.html" target="body"><u>pewter buckle
frames</u></a> were found on
and near the skull (possibly part of a head band) and a large cord-marked
<a href="../excavations/slid_alq.html" target="body"><u>ceramic bowl</u></a> lay
near the chest.<p>
