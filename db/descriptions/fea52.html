	This shallow basin, located at 251.4L4.3, was identified during 1986 but was
not excavated.  This feature was oval in plan dimension, approximately 2.0 ft
in diameter, and intruded the <a href="../excavations/exc_iu.html" target="_top"><u>Structure 11</u></a> wall trench.  Augering in the center
indicated that it lacked any appreciable depth.<p>
